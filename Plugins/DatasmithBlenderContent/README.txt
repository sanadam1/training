Blender Datasmith Additions for Unreal Engine
=============================================

This plugin improves Unreal Engine's support for importing Datasmith files
exported from Blender. It does this by providing implementations of Blender
material nodes and other features native to Blender.

You can also use these nodes directly if desired.

This can be installed in two ways:

- You can copy the DatasmithBlenderContent folder into the "Plugins" folder
  inside your project. If this folder doesn't exist you can create it.

- You can copy this plugin into the Plugins folder of the Unreal Engine
  installation directory.

If you install the plugin in the engine directory, you won't need to add it to
the projects to enable it, but other people that work on the projects will need
to install it into their engines as well.

about the plugin.
